# Kerbin-Side Skyways :: Change Log

* 2016-0523: 1.0.3 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1.2
	+ Added landing guidance to several of the runways.
	+ To use landing guidance you need the latest Kerbal Konstructs.
	+ When close to a base with landing guidance (approximately 25km in most cases), switch on ATC in the Inflight Base Boss to activate the landing guidance HUD.
	+ Note that a few runways have a limited guidance system or no guidance system at all. This isn't a bug - it's a design choice.
* 2016-0424: 1.0.2.1 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1.2
	+ No longer bundling dependency Kerbal Konstructs. You need to get that separately.
* 2016-0330: 1.0.2 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ Now includes the 1.1 compatible version of Kerbal Konstructs.
* 2016-0308: 1.0.1 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ No changelog provided
